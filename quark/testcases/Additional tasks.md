# Additional tasks 

*These tasks aren't mandatory, but they will be appreciated! They should be considered as examples of useful contributions, don't be scared of being creative*

Additional Tasks come in two flavours:

    Technical contributions (creating explorers, bots, public nodes, installers, etc.)
    Social contributions (tweets and threads, articles and videos, infographics etc.)

To make your life easier, we've made public some of our best visuals, as well as our logo, primary colors, etc. You can find them here: https://github.com/neutron-org/brandbook

Additional tasks can be submitted via dedicated channels in the Quark Testnet category:

    #tasks-social: for tweets, videos, articles, infographics, etc.
    #tasks-technical: for bots, explorers, installers, analytics, public nodes, etc.

Once you click on the channel, you will see a collection of posts, each one with a topic. Simply click on the right topic and share you contribution in the comment with a link.

## Feel free to use this [brandbook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bIUQ4-ejI7OX8zhYWZRy2nCgPGbQj6F7) with visual assets, colors and logos in your work!

### 1. *Run chain explorer* <br/>
> You could run your own explorer for the Neutron chain. It could include features that Neutron will use on mainnet, such as a smart-contracts counter and so on.

### 2. *Run alerting bots* <br/>
> Help prepare the ground for mainnet operations: Validators and participants should know about governance proposals, validator's activity etc.

### 3. *Make a video about Neutron* <br/>
> Express yourself! Tell to community about the Neutron for example: <br/>
- How it works (you could translate in into your language for example)
- Your own thoughts and vision about the Neutron
- Neutron's potential usecases etc. 

### 4. *Make a video about ICA, ICQ + CW* <br/>
> You will be the firsts to interact with this! Help the community and those who are still onboarding understand what these features can do, and how to use them!
- Explain it in your language
- Explain it for non-tech people
- Record some workshops for ICA,ICQ +CW 

### 5. *Make a tweet/retweet about Neutron in your socials* <br/>
> We know guys that you're influencers! Then spread the word! It might be on your Twitter, YouTube, Medium and so on. 

### 6. *Create an installer like [https://docs.osmosis.zone/networks/join-testnet#osmosis-cli](https://docs.osmosis.zone/networks/join-testnet#osmosis-cli) <br/>
> The Cosmos SDK is meant to be simple, compatible and easy to use. Let's follow the same philosophy with Neutron's onboarding process. 

### 7. *Connect your validator to Prometheus analytics* <br/>

### 8. *Write & publish an article* <br/>
> You can re-use topics from 3. and 4, or write about a topics of your choice. Remember that quality is the key! 

### 9. *Identify issues and suggest improvements for the testnet documentation* <br/>
> Find a bug and receive a hug! 

### 10. *Run Neutron on different platforms (darwin, linux, arm, etc.)* <br/>
> Let's check how it will work! 

### 11. *Deploy a dApp on Neutron* 
You could try to run apps and tools which generally used on smart-contract platforms such as:
- DEX
- Lending
- Explorer
- Tools for simplifying interaction with smart-contracts like JunoTools, Multisigs and so on
- Wallets
- NFT markets
