# Additional tasks 

## For validators
*These tasks aren't mandatory, but they will be appreciated! They should be considered as examples of useful contributions, don't be scared of using your own creativity!*

### 1. *Run chain explorer* <br/>
You could run your own explorer for the Neutron chain. It could include features that Neutron will use on mainnet, such as a smart-contracts counter and so on.

### 2. *Run alerting bots* <br/>
Help prepare the ground for mainnet operations: Validators and participants should know about governance proposals, validator's activity etc.

### 3. *Make a video about Neutron* <br/>
Express yourself! Tell to community about the Neutron for example: <br/>
- How it works (you could translate in into your language for example)
- Your own thoughts and vision about the Neutron
- Neutron's potential usecases etc. 

### 4. *Make a video about ICA, ICQ + CW* <br/>
You will be the firsts to interact with this! Help the community and those who are still onboarding understand what these features can do, and how to use them!
- Explain it in your language
- Explain it for non-tech people
- Record some workshops for ICA,ICQ +CW 

### 5. *Make a tweet/retweet about Neutron in your socials* <br/>
We know guys that you're influencers! Then spread the word! It might be on your Twitter, YouTube, Medium and so on. 

### 6. *Create an installer like [https://docs.osmosis.zone/networks/join-testnet#osmosis-cli](https://docs.osmosis.zone/networks/join-testnet#osmosis-cli) <br/>
The Cosmos SDK is meant to be simple, compatible and easy to use. Let's follow the same philosophy with Neutron's onboarding process. 

### 7. *Connect your validator to Prometheus analytics* <br/>

### 8. *Write & publish an article* <br/>
You can re-use topics from 3. and 4, or write about a topics of your choice. Remember that quality is the key! 

### 9. *Identify issues and suggest improvements for the testnet documentation* <br/>
Find a bug and receive a hug! 

### 10. *Run Neutron on different platforms (darwin, linux, arm, etc.)* <br/>
Let's check how it will work!
