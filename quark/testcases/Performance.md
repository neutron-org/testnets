# Perfomance Testcases 

*Important Note: We'll publish submission form for this task ASAP* <br/>
## 1. Liveness
> The less blocks your validator will miss the better
## 2. Spam a million transfer transactions from a single address
> Try to send as much as possible transactions to the blockchain. We will announce exact date.
## 3. Completely fill all validatorâ€™s bio including security_contact attribute
## 4. Check how binary will work in situation of lack of free space
## 5. Complete all types of tx
> Try to make different types of transactions (send, delegate, create proposal etc.)
## 6. Stop and reload your validator at least 3 times during testnet phase
## 7. Upgrade without jail or missing blocks 
> We will prepare upgrade proposal and make an announcement
## 8. Get jailed and come back

Did we miss something? Feel free to create PR with your additions (if it's important)
