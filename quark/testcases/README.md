# Testnet tasks and submission guidelines
In this directory, you will find a collection of technical and social tasks which will contribute to the safety of Neutron as a blockchain, as well as raise awareness about the project's features.

As a participating validator, your focus should be on completing testcases. This includes:
- Interchain Accounts (ICA) and Interchain Queries (ICQ)
- Signing methods
- Performance

### Additional Tasks
Once you're done with the testcases, we invite you to take a look at Additional Tasks. Their completion is not required, but will be very appreciated. Since Quark is not incentivized, grinding tasks in the expectation of profit would be a waste of your time. 
That being said, if you decide to contribute to Neutron nonetheless, we will be tremendously grateful for it.

Additional Tasks come in two flavours:
- Technical contributions (creating explorers, bots, public nodes, installers, etc.)
- Social contributions (tweets and threads, articles and videos, infographics etc.)

To make your life easier, we've made public some of our best visuals, as well as our logo, primary colors, etc.
You can find them here: https://github.com/neutron-org/brandbook

### Submission guidelines
We will be collecting testcase results and contributions separately. Please follow these instructions to help us process everyone's work efficiently:

Once you've completed all of the testcases, please submit your results via the dedicated form. You can find it on Discord in the #testcase-form channel.

Additional tasks can be submitted via dedicated channels in the Quark Testnet category:
- #tasks-social: for tweets, videos, articles, infographics, etc.
- #tasks-technical: for bots, explorers, installers, analytics, public nodes, etc.

Once you click on the channel, you will see a collection of posts, each one with a topic. Simply click on the right topic and share you contribution in the comment with a link.
